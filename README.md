### Hej, hi, hola! I am Angela 👋 👩🏻‍💻  

I am a biologist with a PhD, specialized in bioinformatics, genomics, data visualization, and data stewardship. I have 10+ years of experience leading research projects in the academic sector. I am passionate about applying my computational and organisational skills to extract valuable information from large and complex data sets to solve practical problems.

I am currently a data steward / bioinformatician at SciLifeLab Data Centre in Uppsala, Sweden. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Leif Andersson group at Uppsala University, Sweden. I completed my PhD at Dalhousie University, Canada, and my BSc at ​Universidad del Valle, Colombia.
